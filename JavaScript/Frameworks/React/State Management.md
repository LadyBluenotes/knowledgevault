- **State management**: The process of tracking and maintaining an application's state across multiple data flows, ensuring the app's condition is understood at any moment.
- **State**: Represents the condition of an app, stored as variables or constants based on user inputs.
- **Core business applications**: Depend on state management to process sensitive information (e.g., orders, payments) and ensure real-world business processes are reflected.

**How State Management Works:**

- **Data structures**: State management makes the app's state visible via data structures, helping developers track and manage state.
- **State management models**:
  - **Front-end (client-side)**: The app/browser maintains the state, ensuring the UI and user actions are synchronized.
  - **Back-end (server-side)**: The server uses external databases to record and retrieve the state, syncing the UI with the session's state.

**Types of State:**

- **Local state**: Managed by a single component, not accessible by other components.
- **Inter-module state**: State shared between parent and child components.
- **Global state**: State across the entire application, impacting how it interacts with users and other applications.

**State Management Libraries:**

- Libraries help implement state management by providing tools to handle front-end or back-end state management efficiently.
- Libraries speed up development, enforce best practices, and make code easier to maintain.
- **Examples of state management libraries**: React (with libraries like Redux, MobX, Zustand), Vue, Angular.

**State Management in Application Development:**

- **Early applications**: Controlled user dialog, where steps were dictated by the process.
- **Web apps (HTML)**: Stateless by default, requiring clear state management practices to ensure correct handling of data and session states.

**Advantages of State Management:**

- **Stability and reliability**: Maintains consistent data, reducing errors and conflicts.
- **Performance improvements**: Enables features like data caching, enhancing speed and responsiveness.
- **Better debugging**: Predictable data flow makes troubleshooting easier.
- **Better design**: Helps developers address communication issues between components.

**State Management Tools:**

- Front-end tools are commonly used for state management, especially for web apps.
- **React**: A popular front-end framework that aids in state management, often combined with libraries like Redux or Zustand.
- **Specialized libraries**: Libraries like Cerebral, Hookstate, Jotai focus on specific state management tasks.
