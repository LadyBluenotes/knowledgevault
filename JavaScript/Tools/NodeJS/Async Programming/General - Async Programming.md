- Enables programs to start potentially long-running tasks rather than having to wait until the task is finished
    - Once task is finished, program can present result
- Async code means that things can happen *independently* of the main program flow
- Async functions in JS are processed in the *background* without **blocking** other requests
    - Ensures non-blocking code execution
- Executes without having any dependency and no order
- Improves system efficiency and throughput

- Many functions provided by browsers can potentially take time and are, therefore, async
    - Examples include:
        - HTTP requests using `fetch()`
        - Accessing userâ€™s camera or microphone using `getUserMedia()`
        - Asking a user to select files using `showOpenFilePicker()`

## Synchronous programming
- When code is executed in the order that it is written
- When browser waits for a line to finish its work, before going to the next line
    - Done this way because each line **depends** on the work done on the preceding lines

### Problems with long-running synchronous functions
- JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning a program consists of a single thread and can only do one thing at a time
- What is instead needed is:
    1. Start a long-running operation by calling a function
    2. Have that function start the operation and return immediately, so program can still be responsive to other events
    3. Have the function execute the operation in a way that does not block the main thread (eg. by starting new thread)
    4. Notify when the result eventually completes

## Event handlers
- A form of async programming: you provide a function (event handler) that will be called, not right away, but whenever the event happens
- The [XMLHttpRequest](XMLHttprequest.md) API enables the ability to make HTTP requests to a remote server using JS
    - Can take a long time and thus you will get notified about the progress and eventual completion of a request by attaching event listeners to the `XMLHttpRequest` object
