## Block scope

- Restricts the variable that is declared inside a specific block, from access by the outside of the block.
- `let` and `const` keywords create block-scoped variables

## Function scope

- When a variable is declared inside a function, it is only accessible within that function and cannot be used outside that function

## Global Scope
- Variables outside of any function have Global Scope.
- These variables can be accessed *anywhere* within a JS program.
