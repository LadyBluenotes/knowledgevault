| React    | What is React?                 | - an **open-source front-end JavaScript library** that is <br>- used for building composable user interfaces, especially for single-page applications<br>- used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps based on components in a declarative approach                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|          | What is JSX?                   | - Uses **JSX** syntax, a syntax extension of JS that allows developers to write HTML in their JS code.<br>- It uses **Virtual DOM** instead of Real DOM<br>- Supports **server-side rendering** which is useful for Search Engine Optimizations(SEO).<br>- Follows **Unidirectional or one-way** data flow or data binding.<br>- Uses **reusable/composable** UI components to develop the view.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|          | Major features?                | - stands for _JavaScript XML_ and it is an XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript<br>- provides the syntactic sugar for the `React.createElement(type, props, ...children)` function, giving the expressiveness of JavaScript along with HTML like template syntax<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|          | element vs component?          | - _Element_ is a plain object that describes what you want to appear on the screen in terms of the DOM nodes or other components<br>- _Elements_ can contain other _Elements_ in their props<br>- Creating a React _Element_ is inexpensive<br>- Once an _Element_ is created, it cannot be mutated<br>- a **component** can be declared in several different ways<br>- can be a class with a render() method or it can be defined as a function<br>- takes props as an input, and returns a JSX tree as the output                                                                                                                                |
|          | How to create a component?     | **Function Components:** This is the simplest way to create a component. Those are pure JavaScript functions that accept props object as the one and only one parameter and return React elements to render the output<br>Class Components: You can also use ES6 class to define a component                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|          | When to use class vs function? | **Class**:<br>- you need a React functionality whose Function component equivalent is not present yet, like Error Boundaries<br>- In older versions, If the component needs _state or lifecycle methods_ then you need to use class component<br>- If you need to manage state or use lifecycle methods<br>- In scenarios where backward compatibility or integration with older code is necessary<br><br>**Function**:<br>- you don't need state or lifecycle methods, and your component is purely presentational<br>- For simplicity, readability, and modern code practices, especially with the use of React Hooks for state and side effects |
|          | Pure Components?               | - components which render the same output for the same state and props<br>- achieve these pure components through memoized API wrapping around the component<br>- API prevents unnecessary re-renders by comparing the previous props and new props using shallow comparison<br>- helpful for performance optimizations<br>- won't compare the previous state with the current state because function component itself prevents the unnecessary rendering by default when you set the same state again                                                                                                                                             |
|          | What is state?                 | - State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component<br>- whenever the state object changes, the component re-renders<br>- State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|          | What are props?                | - inputs to components<br>- single values or objects containing a set of values that are passed to components on creation similar to HTML-tag attributes<br>- data is passed down from a parent component to a child component<br>- properties from props object can be accessed directly using destructing feature<br>- also possible to fallback to default value when the prop value is not specified<br>Primary purpose:<br>- Pass custom data to your component<br>- Trigger state changes                                                                                                                                                    |
|          | State vs props?                | - both state and props are plain JavaScript objects and used to manage the data of a component<br>**State:**<br>- managed by the component itself and can be updated using the setter<br>- can be modified by the component and is used to manage the internal state of the component<br>- changes in the state trigger a re-render of the component and its children<br>**Props:**<br>- passed to a component by its parent component and are read-only, meaning that they cannot be modified by the own component itself<br>- can be used to configure the behavior of a component and to pass data between components                           |
