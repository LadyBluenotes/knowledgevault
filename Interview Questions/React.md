| How does the useEffect Hook work?                                  | - `useEffect` hook in React lets you perform **side effects** (like data fetching, DOM manipulation, or subscriptions) in function components<br>- runs **after render**, and you can control when it runs using a **dependency array**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| How would you manage state in a larger application?                | **Local**: Things like `useState` if logic doesn’t need to be shared globally<br>**Global:** Context API for lightweight global state (eg. auth, theme) for small to medium (depends because it can get messy)<br>State management library - help manage complex state, cache data, handle async logic<br>**Modular architecture:** split state logically by feature or domain to make it easier to test and maintain                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| How do you make sure an app isn’t unnecessarily rerendering?       | - **Use `React.memo()`** for functional components to memoize output unless props change.<br> <br>- **Use `useCallback()`** to memoize functions passed as props.<br> <br>- **Use `useMemo()`** to memoize expensive computations.<br> <br>- **Avoid inline functions/objects** in JSX when unnecessary.<br> <br>- **Split large components** into smaller ones to isolate updates.<br> <br>- **Use key props efficiently** when rendering lists (avoid index as key if items can change).<br> <br>- **Avoid frequent state updates** — batch changes when possible.<br> <br>- **Use state only when needed** — derive values from props or context if no reactivity is required.<br> <br>- **Optimize context usage** — avoid large contexts that trigger re-renders across many consumers. |
| Explain how routing might work in react?                           | - routing controls which component displays based on the URL, allowing for a single-page app (SPA) experience where the page doesn’t reload<br>- React Router - most popular way<br>- BrowserRouter for access to the browser history api<br>- Routes and Route - Map a path to a component<br>- Navigation - Link `useNavigate` to move between pages without reloading the page                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Explain the differences between props and state?                   | **Props:**<br>- **Immutable**: Cannot be changed by the component receiving them.<br>- **Passed from Parent**: Used to pass data from a parent component to a child component.<br>- **Read-Only**: Child components can only read props, not modify them.<br>- **Use Case**: For passing data or event handlers between components.<br><br>**State:**<br>- **Mutable**: Can be changed within the component using `setState` (class) or `useState` (functional).<br>- **Component-Specific**: Managed within the component and typically represents the component's own data.<br>- **Read/Write**: The component can update its own state.<br>- **Use Case**: For managing internal data that affects the component’s rendering (like form input values or toggled states).                  |
| What is useRef and how would you implement it?                     | - used to persist values across renders without triggering a re-render<br><br>**Use:**<br>- For **DOM manipulation** (e.g., focusing, measuring dimensions).<br>- For **tracking mutable values** across renders without causing re-renders (e.g., timers, previous props, or state values).<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| How do you add styling to a React project?                         | **Inline styling:** Directly in JSX, using the `style` attribute (not recommended)<br>**CSS Stylesheets:** Global scope<br>**CSS Modules:** Scoped styles that are local to component<br>**Styled components:** Writing CSS directly inside JS files using template literals<br>**TailwindCSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for styling directly in JSX using utility classes <br>**SASS/SCSS:** More advanced CSS features (but CSS now supports things like nesting so not as often)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| What’s OOP?                                                        | - a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic<br><br>**Main principles:**<br>- _Encapsulation_: All important information is contained within an object and only select information is exposed (ie. implementation and state vs public functions or methods)<br>- _Abstraction_: Only reveal internal mechanisms relevant for use of other objects, hiding unnecessary implementation<br>- _Inheritance_: Reuse code and properties from other classes. <br>- _Polymorphism_: you can access objects of different types through the same interface                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Explain async/await                                                | - **`async`**: This keyword is used to define a function as asynchronous. It means the function can perform non-blocking operations, such as fetching data or waiting for a timeout, without freezing the whole program.<br> <br>- **`await`**: This keyword is used _inside_ an `async` function to pause the execution until a **Promise** is resolved (e.g., when data is returned from a server). It makes asynchronous code look and behave like synchronous code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| What’s the difference between Class and Function components?       | **Function components** are simpler, modern components defined using JavaScript functions. They use **React Hooks** (like `useState`, `useEffect`) to manage state and lifecycle logic. They're more concise and now the standard way to write components in React.<br><br>**Class components** are the older way of writing components in React. They use ES6 classes and manage state and lifecycle methods through class syntax (like this.state, componentDidMount). They're still valid but less commonly used in new projects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| What does the second argument of the useEffect hook do?            | - is an **optional dependency array** that controls when the effect runs. It allows you to specify which values should trigger the effect to rerun when they change<br><br>- **Empty Array (`[]`)**: Runs the effect **once** after the initial render, similar to `componentDidMount` in class components.<br>    <br>- **No Array**: Runs the effect **after every render** (on every update).<br>    <br>- **With Dependencies**: Runs the effect **only when any value in the array changes**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| How would you display a list of items that are stored in an array? | - **map()**: This method is used to iterate over each item in the array. For each item, it returns a `<li>` element.<br><br>- **key**: React requires a `key` prop when rendering lists to help identify each item in the list uniquely. We use the `index` as the key, but in a real-world scenario, it's better to use a unique identifier for each item if possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
