| How does the useEffect Hook work?                                  | - `useEffect` hook in React lets you perform **side effects** (like data fetching, DOM manipulation, or subscriptions) in function components<br>- runs **after render**, and you can control when it runs using a **dependency array**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| How would you manage state in a larger application?                | **Local**: Things like `useState` if logic doesn’t need to be shared globally<br>**Global:** Context API for lightweight global state (eg. auth, theme) for small to medium (depends because it can get messy)<br>State management library - help manage complex state, cache data, handle async logic<br>**Modular architecture:** split state logically by feature or domain to make it easier to test and maintain                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| How do you make sure an app isn’t unnecessarily rerendering?       | - **Use `React.memo()`** for functional components to memoize output unless props change.<br> <br>- **Use `useCallback()`** to memoize functions passed as props.<br> <br>- **Use `useMemo()`** to memoize expensive computations.<br> <br>- **Avoid inline functions/objects** in JSX when unnecessary.<br> <br>- **Split large components** into smaller ones to isolate updates.<br> <br>- **Use key props efficiently** when rendering lists (avoid index as key if items can change).<br> <br>- **Avoid frequent state updates** — batch changes when possible.<br> <br>- **Use state only when needed** — derive values from props or context if no reactivity is required.<br> <br>- **Optimize context usage** — avoid large contexts that trigger re-renders across many consumers. |

| Explain async/await                                                | - **`async`**: This keyword is used to define a function as asynchronous. It means the function can perform non-blocking operations, such as fetching data or waiting for a timeout, without freezing the whole program.<br> <br>- **`await`**: This keyword is used _inside_ an `async` function to pause the execution until a **Promise** is resolved (e.g., when data is returned from a server).

| What’s the difference between Class and Function components?       | **Function components** are simpler, modern components defined using JavaScript functions. They use **React Hooks** (like `useState`, `useEffect`) to manage state and lifecycle logic. They're more concise and now the standard way to write components in React.<br><br>**Class components** are the older way of writing components in React. They use ES6 classes and manage state and lifecycle methods through class syntax (like this.state, componentDidMount).
