# heap

A tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property, meaning that a parent node's value is always greater than or equal to its children's value (in a max-heap) or less than or equal to (in a min-heal).

Often used in priority queues and is also the basis for the heapsort algorithm.

# stack

A linear data structure that follows LIFO (Last In First Out) Principle, the last element inserted is the first to be popped out.

---

# first-class functions

When functions in a language are treated like any other variable.

For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable.

---

# Prototype-based

Simplified: Allows for the creation of an object without first defining its class.

Style of object-orientated programming in which classes are not explicitly defined, but derived by adding properties and methods to an instance of another class or, less frequently, adding them to an empty object.

---

# single-threaded

Executes only one instruction at a time

---

# dynamic-typed

Interpreter assigns variables a type at runtime based on the variable's value at the time.

---
# camelCase

The practice of writing phrases without spaces or punctuation and with capitalized words. The format indicates the first word starting with either case, then the following words having an initial uppercase letter.

---
# block scope

*block scopes, block-scope, block-scoped*

The area within curly braces `{ }`. 

Variables that are declared within a block scope are only accessible within that specific block of code, not outside of it.

---
# function-scoped

Variables defined inside a function cannot be accessed from anywhere outside the function.

The function scope inherits from all upper scopes. For example, a function defined in the global scope can access all variables in the global scope.

---
# global-scoped

In a programming environment, global scope is the scope that contains, and is visible in, all other scopes. 

This means that globally-scoped variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.

---
# hoisting

*hoistings, hoisted, hoist*

Refers to the process where an interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, variables, classes, or imports to the top of their scope, prior to the execution of the code.

---
# temporal dead zone

The period between entering a scope and the actual declaration of a variable using let or const. During this period, the variable is in an "uninitialized" state and accessing it will result in a `ReferenceError`.

---
# syntactic sugar

Syntax with a programming language that is designed to make things easier to read or express. This can include things being expressed more clearly, more concisely, or in an alternative style that some may prefer.

Usually shorthand for a common operation that could be expressed in an alternative, more verbose form.
